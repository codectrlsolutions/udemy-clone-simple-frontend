                        Udemy is a technology platform that enables anyone anywhere to create and share educational content. We
                        host hundreds and thousands of courses on our online learning marketplace. Our marketplace model means
                        we don’t review or edit the content for legal issues, and we aren’t in a position to determine the
                        legality of the content. However, Udemy respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects
                        instructors on Udemy to do the same. When instructors post content on Udemy, they make the promise that
                        they have the necessary authorization or rights to use that content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Infringing activity is not tolerated on or through our platform.

                    <p>
                        This policy addresses what we do in the event of copyright takedown notices from content owners and
                        trademark takedown notices from trademark owners with respect to the content on the Udemy platform. The
                        policy also addresses what we do when Udemy instructors’ courses are copied on third-party platforms
                        without their consent.

                        than two valid copyright takedown notices). We reserve the right to terminate an instructor’s account at
                        any time, including when they post content in violation of the copyrights of others.

                        If you’d like to report content on the Udemy platform and if you are the owner or the designated agent
                        of the owner of the rights to the content that you believe the content is infringing, the most efficient
                        way is to use this <a href="https://copyright.udemy.com">copyright complaint form</a> (form in English
                        only). You may also submit notices of alleged copyright infringement to our designated copyright agent,

                            <strong>We cannot process a copyright claim that is not submitted by the owner of the copyright or
                                its designated agent.</strong> This is because we have no way of knowing whether the instructor
                            who published the content you are reporting has received proper permission from the owner to use the
                            content. We’ll ask you to provide an electronic signature to confirm that you’re the copyright owner
                            or have authority to represent the copyright owner (including if the copyright owner is an
                            organization). If you don’t own the content that you’re reporting, you’re welcome to reach out to
                            the owner and provide them with Udemy’s <a href="https://copyright.udemy.com">copyright complaint

                            <strong>Knowingly submitting a false or misleading copyright takedown notice is illegal and you
                                could be held liable and have to pay damages as a result.</strong> Udemy reserves the right to
                            seek damages from anyone who submits a notification of claimed infringement in violation of the law.

                            <strong>Consider whether the use of your material in the content is “fair use.”</strong> Copyright
                            law includes a “fair use” exception for certain uses of copyrighted content that are considered to
                            be in the public interest. Before you submit a copyright claim, make sure that use of the copied
                            content does not qualify as fair use. Fair use covers things like criticism, commentary, news
                            reporting, and research. In considering whether the content’s use of your material qualifies as fair
                            use, you should look at:
                            <ul>

                                    The purpose of the use (whether the content is paid or unpaid, whether the content
                                    critiques/parodies/transforms your material)
                                </li>

                                    The type of copyrighted work being used (whether your work is factual or creative)

                                <li>
                                    The portion being used (whether the content uses small, necessary excerpts of your material
                                    or substantial portions of it)
                                </li>

                        If we receive a valid copyright takedown notice, we’ll send a copy of that notice to the instructor who
                        posted the reported content along with a notification that: (1) the content was reported for copyright
                        infringement and (2) we’re removing the content from the Udemy platform. We’ll also attach a form that
                        the instructor can fill in and send back to us to submit a counter-notification. If your content has
                        been reported for copyright infringement and removed from the Udemy platform, and if you believe we made
                        a mistake or that you have permission from the owner of the reported content to use such content, then
                        you may send us a counter-notification.

                        <strong>Knowingly submitting a false or misleading counter-notification to a claim of infringement is
                            illegal and you could be held liable and have to pay damages as a result.</strong> Udemy reserves
                        the right to seek damages from any party that submits a counter-notification of claimed infringement or
                        counter-notification in violation of the law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best way to provide us with a counter-notification is to fill in the form we provided you and send
                        it back to the Udemy designated agent or the copyright team member who notified you. To be effective, a
                        counter-notification must be in writing and include the following information:
                    </p>

                            was removed (you can access this information from the copyright takedown notice filed against your
                            content; we always attach a copy when we notify you);

                            law protects the use of a name or brand for selling products and services, with the goal of
                            preventing consumer confusion. Most countries’ laws include an exception for “fair use”, which
                            allows others to use a trademark for factually referencing the trademarked product or service, or
                            commenting on or criticizing the mark. Consider the likelihood that others would be confused into
                            thinking that your company or brand had created or is sponsoring the content. Before you submit a
                            trademark claim, make sure that use of your trademark in the content does not qualify as fair use.

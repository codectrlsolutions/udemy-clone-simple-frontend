            </p>
            <p>
                (d) <i>Follow and Comply with All Copyright Laws:</i> It is entirely Your responsibility to follow and
                comply with all applicable copyright and other laws that pertain to Your website. We will not be
                responsible if You use another person's copyrighted material in violation of the law.

            </p>
            <p>
                (g) <i>You will not mimic Our media and content:</i> Publishers must make sure that his or her media
                does not copy or resemble the look and feel of the Udemy website or create the impression that Your
                media is part of Our company's website. You also understand that using the language found on Our pages

            <h2>5. Affiliate Commissions</h2>
            <p>
                (a) <i>Eligibility:</i> Except in jurisdictions in which such a transaction is not permitted, You are
                eligible to earn affiliate commissions through Referrals (as defined in section (b) below) during the
                term of these Affiliate Terms, according to the calculation described below.
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) <i>Amount due:</i> The exact amount of affiliate commissions due to You in any given quarter will be
                calculated in the following manner:
            </p>
            <p>
                The affiliate commission is set up in the offers available to You in Your Publisher account. A
                “Referral” is a paying customer that You refer from Your website to Our website using the Referral
                Materials in accordance with the Referral Specifications. Acceptance of a Referral as a User of Our
                Services shall be at Our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
                (c) Payment of affiliate commissions will be made on a monthly basis. Payments are disbursed according
                to the payment method You have selected in Your affiliate account. If Your account is terminated due to
                violation of these Affiliate Terms, We reserve the right to withhold all future payments owed to You.
            </p>
            <p>
                (d) Affiliate payments are sent to you using Linkshare’s affiliate network payment system. Udemy does
                not send payment directly to any affiliates. Affiliates are responsible for making sure they are able to
                accept payments from Udemy's affiliate network.
            </p>
            <p>
                (e) Affiliates are responsible for any and all charges, fees, taxes, exchange rates, surcharges and
                other expenses incurred in order to receive affiliate payments. Please check with your receiving banking
                institution to find out if any of these apply for your account.
            </p>
            <p>
                (f) If We determine that payment of affiliate commissions to You in any jurisdiction is illegal under
                any laws, then We may reserve the right to not pay affiliate commissions for any sales made in that
                jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                (g) We may withhold Your final payment for a reasonable time to ensure that the correct amount is paid
                to You.
            </p>
            <p>
                (h) If at any time there has been no substantial activity on your account for XX years, then we will
                have the right to withhold any accrued fee. Further, any unpaid fees in your account may be subject to
                escheatment under applicable law.
            </p>

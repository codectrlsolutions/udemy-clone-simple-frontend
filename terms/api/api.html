            <p><i>
                    These API Terms were last updated on June 1, 2023.
                </i></p>
            <p>
                At Udemy, we believe in improving lives through learning. Whether you want to share what you know or
                learn something new, you’ve come to the right place. We also help organizations of all types and sizes
                prepare for the path ahead — wherever it leads. To achieve these goals, we offer development tools to
                enable our users to create applications that connect with the Udemy platform. Our hope is to create a
                thriving community of applications built around Udemy that balances the various needs around the
                protection of our systems, our learners, and our business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read the below agreement carefully. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not proceed.
            </p>
            <h2><b>1. Purpose.</b></h2>
            <p>
                1.1 <u>Parties</u>. This API License Agreement (<strong><i>“Agreement”</i></strong>) is between Udemy,
                Inc. (<strong><i>“Udemy”</i></strong>, <strong><i>“us”</i></strong>, or <strong><i>“we”</i></strong>),
                and you, or the individual, company, or other entity that you represent (<strong><i>“you”</i></strong>).
                By building applications that interact with Udemy’s products and services, including data related
                thereto (collectively the “ Services”) or by accessing or using any application programming interfaces,
                developer tools, or other related documentation and materials (collectively “APIs”) made available by
                Udemy, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and any accompanying documentation that applies to your
                use of the APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                1.2 <u>Other Agreements</u>. This Agreement governs your use of the Udemy APIs. If you are a customer,
                reseller, or value-added service partner of Udemy Business, you may be required to execute a separate
                agreement governing your access or right to license the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                1.3 <u>Use on Behalf of an Entity</u>. If you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of your employer or
                another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer
                or such entity to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree
                to this Agreement on behalf of the party that you represent.
            </p>
            <p>
                1.4 <u>Modification of Terms</u>. We may modify this Agreement at any time with or without individual
                notice to you. Any modifications will be effective upon your continued use of the APIs. Please review
                this Agreement periodically and check the “Last Updated” date for any potential changes.
            </p>
            <h2><b>2. Using the Udemy APIs.</b></h2>
            <p>
                2.1 <b>API License.</b> Subject to this Agreement, Udemy grants you a limited worldwide, non-exclusive,
                non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable license to use and make calls to the APIs solely to
                facilitate the interoperability of the Services and the software applications, websites, or other tools
                using the APIs created by you (each, an <strong><i>“App”</i></strong>). You may use the APIs only as
                expressly permitted in this Agreement. Violation of this Agreement may result in the immediate
                suspension or termination of your use of the APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.2 <u>Obligations.</u> You agree to comply and require all your users to comply with all applicable
                laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of data or software and privacy
                laws, and any guidelines provided by Udemy.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.3 <u>Monitoring.</u> You agree that Udemy may monitor your use of the APIs to ensure quality, to
                improve Services, and to verify your compliance with the Agreement. You agree to assist Udemy with this
                monitoring by providing Udemy with information about your App. If you do not demonstrate full compliance
                with this Agreement, Udemy may restrict or terminate your access to the APIs without notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.4 <u>Reservation of Certain Rights.</u> At any point in the future, Udemy reserves the right to do any
                of the following: (1) offer or cease to offer support for the APIs; (2) modify the APIs and require you
                to use those subsequent versions; (3) require you to use the APIs in a different manner; (4) deprecate
                any API; or (5) independently develop products or services that may serve the same purpose as your App.

                malicious automated program or script, including web spiders, crawlers, robots, indexers, bots, viruses
                or worms, or any program intended to overburden or hinder the operation and/or performance of the API;
                (c) attempt to circumvent the limitations Udemy sets on your use of the APIs; (d) engage in deceptive,
                misleading, illegal, or unethical activities, or activities that otherwise may be detrimental to the

                violates applicable law, including laws regarding libel, slander, obscenity, and infringement; (b) in
                any way that is misleading, implies that your App is approved, created, or endorsed by Udemy (or

                Udemy in its sole discretion. You must promptly cease any use of the Udemy TMs identified by Udemy as

            </p>
            <p>
                6.4 <u>Notification</u>. In the event of a Security Incident, you will be solely responsible, at your
                own expense, for investigation, remediation, and your own notifications to affected users and regulatory
                authorities in accordance with applicable laws and industry standards. However, you must obtain our

                granted herein, and your license to the APIs, in our sole discretion at any time, for any reason. You
                may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing your access to the APIs.

                OR IMPLIED, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF THE APIs. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF
                THE APIs IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT WE PROVIDE THE APIs ON AN "AS IS" BASIS "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND "AS
                AVAILABLE" TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAW, WE EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING
                FOR MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, AND

                INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS, IF THEY ARE APPLICABLE. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE APIs WILL FUNCTION
                WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR ERRORS IN FUNCTIONING. IN PARTICULAR, THE OPERATION OF THE APIs MAY BE
                INTERRUPTED DUE TO MAINTENANCE, UPDATES, OR SYSTEM OR NETWORK FAILURES. WE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR
                DAMAGES CAUSED BY ANY SUCH INTERRUPTION, ERRORS IN FUNCTIONING, OR THAT DATA LOSS WILL NOT OCCUR.
            </p>
            <p>
                8.2 <u>Limitation of Liability</u>. IN NO EVENT WILL UDEMY BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY USERS FOR ANY
                INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO
                USE, DATA, BUSINESS, GOODWILL, OR PROFITS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. IN ANY
                CASE, UDEMY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED $100.00
                USD. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH
                LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT
                LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT UDEMY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR
                DAMAGE. INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT
                SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS TO MAKE THE LIMITATION
                COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAW. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITIES SET FORTH HEREIN
                ARE AGREED ALLOCATIONS OF RISK AND SUCH LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL
                PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.
            </p>
            <p>
                8.3 <u>Indemnification</u>. You shall defend Udemy against any and all actions, demands, claims and
                suits (including without limitation product liability claims), and indemnify and hold Udemy harmless

                fees) to the extent arising out of: (i) your use of the APIs or Services in any manner that is
                inconsistent with this Agreement or any applicable laws, rules, or regulations; or (ii) the performance,
                promotion, sale or distribution of your App. In the event Udemy seeks indemnification or defense from
                you under this provision, Udemy will promptly notify you in writing of the claim(s) brought against
                Udemy for which it seeks indemnification or defense. Udemy reserves the right, at its option and sole
                discretion, to assume full control of the defense of claims with legal counsel of its choice. You may
                not enter into any third-party agreement, which would, in any manner whatsoever, affect the rights of
                Udemy, constitute an admission of fault by Udemy, or bind Udemy in any manner, without the prior written
                consent of Udemy. In the event Udemy assumes control of the defense of such claim, Udemy shall not
                settle any such claim requiring payment from you without your prior written approval.

            <p>
                8.4 <u>No Injunctive Relief</u>. In no event shall you seek or be entitled to rescission, injunctive or

                exercising your rights granted under this Agreement. You may not disclose any Confidential Information
                to any third party without Udemy's prior written consent. You agree that you will protect any
                Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that you would
                use to protect your own confidential and proprietary information.
            </p>

            <p>
                11.4 <u>Severability</u>. If any part of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then

            <p>
                11.6 <u>Assignment</u>. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under this Agreement,
                including in connection with a change of control. Any purported assignment and delegation shall be
                ineffective. We may freely assign or delegate all rights and obligations under this Agreement, fully or
                partially without notice to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                11.7 <u>No Waiver</u>. Either party's failure to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement does not

                11.8 <u>Notices</u>. Notices must be in writing and will be deemed given when delivered. Udemy may

                11.10 <u>Entire Agreement</u>. This Agreement and any documents incorporated by reference, constitute
                the entire agreement between you and us regarding the APIs and supersede all prior agreements and

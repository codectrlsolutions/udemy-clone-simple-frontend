            <h1>Udemy Business Privacy Statement</h1>
            <p><i>
                    This Udemy Business Privacy Statement was updated on March 23, 2023.
                </i></p>
            <p>
                In the course of providing Udemy Business (<strong>“UB”</strong>) services and related services to its
                corporate, non-profit organization, and governmental customers (<strong>“Customers”</strong>), Udemy
                will receive and have access to personal data of individual users to whom customers grant access
                (<strong>“Users”</strong>). For the purposes of this privacy statement, Customers are data controllers
                and Udemy is a data processor. Udemy’s processing of User data and the security measures implemented to
                protect such data are detailed in and governed by a written agreement between Udemy and each of its
                Customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a data processor, Udemy will access, store and use the personal data of individual Users solely for
                the purpose of providing the UB services to its Customers and will process the data as instructed by its
                Customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                As data controllers, Customers decide which of their employees or other authorized personnel are given
                access to the UB services. They do this by designating one or more UB account administrators or group
                administrators (<strong>“Administrator”</strong>) who act on behalf of the Customer and have the ability
                to customize the Customer account, manage individual User accounts, access the UB Insights tool and
                related reporting features, access the UB Administrator tools, and populate the Customer account with
                Customer-provided content. Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring
                compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, relating to the collection of personal information
                relating to individual Users selected by Customers for accessing the UB services. Udemy has no direct
                relationship with individual Users, who should contact Customers (their employer) for assistance with
                any requests or questions relating to the processing of their personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
                For avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Statement <u>does not apply to</u>:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    any processing of data for the purpose of marketing the UB service to enterprise and corporate
                    prospects; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    any other offerings available at Udemy.com separate from the UB services, for which the <a
                        href="/terms/privacy/">Udemy Privacy Policy</a> is applicable. A User may already have an
                    account with Udemy to access Udemy’s consumer marketplace educational content
                    (<strong>“Marketplace”</strong>), and data processed as a result of the use of the Udemy Marketplace
                    from a User account is governed by the <a href="/terms/privacy/">Udemy Privacy Policy</a>.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In the event where Udemy makes any material changes to the manner in which it processes User data to
                provide its services to Customers, it will notify Customers.

                <li>
                    When a User is given access to the UB services by the Administrator, a User may set up an individual
                    User account and Udemy will collect information provided by the User or the Administrator. The
                    Customer can customize the type of data requested to create an account, which may include the
                    following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            first name, last name, and email address required

                            photo, areas of interest, job skills, goals, and role (optionally provided by User or

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            other personal data, as allowed by the Customer
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    A unique identifying number is assigned by Udemy upon the creation of a User account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User profile pages may be viewable by other Users in the same UB organization but are not viewable
                    by individuals outside of the organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Administrators may assign a User to a group membership.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Customers may choose to integrate UB with a Single Sign On (SSO) identity provider to enable Users
                    to log in to UB User accounts without the need to disclose hashed passwords to Udemy. Users may log
                    in by providing their individual SSO credentials to the SSO identity provider, which will
                    authenticate them and allow or deny access to the Customer account. SSO identity providers share
                    with Udemy a unique cookie ID and authentication “token” information to recognize the User as an
                    authorized user of Customer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Customers may choose whether Administrators and Users can interact with others (including with
                    instructors, teaching assistants, and other students) by posting reviews about educational content,
                    messaging or chatting, posting questions or answers, or posting other content. Posted content is
                    stored by Udemy and may be publicly available or viewable by others, including Administrators,
                    Users, or instructors and teaching assistants, depending on where the content is posted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At the option of the Customer, Administrators may enable the ability to “Share to Slack.” This
                    feature allows Users to manually or automatically post a message to the Customer’s own instance of
                    the Slack messaging service. To enable this optional functionality, Customer's Slack administrators
                    must grant Udemy the ability to read the full list of public channels, private channels, and users
                    in the Customer’s Slack instance. These lists may include individuals in Customer’s Slack instance
                    who are not UB Users. Slack user lists and channels are briefly cached before being automatically
                    purged from Udemy's systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Udemy stores information relating to the activities of Users as they use and interact with the UB
                    services, such as content viewed, searched for, or accessed (and information relating to that
                    content); interactions with instructors, teaching assistants, Administrators, and other Users; as
                    well as answers, essays, and other items submitted by Users to satisfy the educational content
                    requirements. This information is linked to a User’s unique account ID and is shared with Customers
                    via the Customer Account reporting tools or upon request of the Customer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The UB service enables Users to contact the Udemy Support Team for assistance or to report a
                    problem, concern, potential abuse, or other issues regarding the UB services or other users. Udemy
                    may collect and store the User’s name, email address, location, operating system, IP address as well
                    as the User’s activity on the Udemy platform and communications with the Udemy help desk team. Udemy
                    may request additional information from Users in order to resolve any issue reported by a User or by
                    another user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a User uses the UB services, Udemy collects and stores certain information by automated means:
                    (a) technical information about the User’s computer or wireless device, such as IP address,
                    operating system type and version, unique device ID, browser, browser language, domain, and other
                    operating systems or platform information. This information is collected through the use of server
                    log files and tracking technologies, such as: (i) cookies, which are small files that websites send
                    to a computer or wireless device to uniquely identify a browser or mobile device or to store
                    information in a browser setting; and (ii) other tracking technologies (see below for more detailed
                    information).
                </li>
                <li>

                    If a Customer makes purchases via credit card, Udemy collects certain data about the purchase (such
                    as name and ZIP code) as necessary to process the order. Customers must provide certain payment and
                    billing data directly to Udemy’s payment processing partners, including name, credit card
                    information, billing address, and ZIP code. Udemy may also receive limited information, like the
                    fact that Customers have a new card and the last four digits of that card, from payment service
                    providers to facilitate payments. For security, Udemy does not collect or store sensitive cardholder
                    data, such as full credit card numbers or card authentication data.

                Like many online platforms, Udemy uses server log files and automated data collection tools, such as
                browser cookies and scripts. Cookies are small text files placed onto a computer or device while
                browsing the Internet. Cookies are used to collect, store, and share bits of information about User
                activities. Udemy uses both session cookies and persistent cookies to deliver and secure the UB service;
                provide functionality, like customizing a user’s view or remembering a user’s preferences; and measure
                site, service, or feature usage. Udemy may tie the information collected by these means to the unique

                Users can adjust their cookie settings by clicking the “Cookie settings” link on the footer of the UB
                site, or they may set their web browser to notify them about the placement of new cookies, limit the

                able to use some or all of the features of the UB services (for example, may not be able to log in).

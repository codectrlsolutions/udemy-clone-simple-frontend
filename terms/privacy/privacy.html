                        advertisers)

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Udemy uses the following types of Data Collection Tools for the purposes described:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                        <li>
                            <u>Strictly Necessary:</u> These Data Collection Tools enable you to access the site,
                            provide
                            basic
                            functionality (like logging in or accessing content), secure the site, protect against
                            fraudulent
                            logins, and
                            detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your account. These are required for the
                            Services to
                            work
                            properly, so if you disable them, parts of the site will break or be unavailable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <u>Functional:</u> These Data Collection Tools remember data about your browser and your
                            preferences, provide
                            additional site functionality, customize content to be more relevant to you, and remember
                            settings
                            affecting the
                            appearance and behavior of the Services (like your preferred language or volume level for
                            video
                            playback).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <u>Performance:</u> These Data Collection Tools help measure and improve the Services by
                            providing
                            usage and
                            performance data, visit counts, traffic sources, or where an application was downloaded
                            from.
                            These
                            tools can
                            help us test different versions of Udemy to see which features or content users prefer and
                            determine
                            which email
                            messages are opened.

                        <li>
                            <u>Advertising:</u> These Data Collection Tools are used to deliver relevant ads (on the
                            site
                            and/or
                            other
                            sites) based on things we know about you like your Usage and System Data (as detailed in
                            Section
                            1),
                            and things
                            that the ad service providers know about you based on their tracking data. The ads can be
                            based
                            on
                            your recent
                            activity or activity over time and across other sites and services. To help deliver tailored
                            advertising, we may
                            provide these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your email address (in
                            a

                            content with

                When you sign up to become an instructor on the Udemy platform, you agree to abide by these Instructor

                instructors and are incorporated by reference into our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Use</a>, the general
                terms that govern your use of our Services. Any capitalized terms that aren't defined in these Terms are
                defined as specified in the Terms of Use.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an instructor, you are contracting directly with Udemy, Inc. (a Delaware corporation in the United
                States), regardless of whether another Udemy subsidiary facilitates payments to you.
            </p>
            <h2>1. Instructor Obligations</h2>
            <p>
                As an instructor, you are responsible for all content that you post, including lectures, quizzes, coding
                exercises, practice tests, assignments, resources, answers, course landing page content, labs,
                assessments, and announcements ("<b>Submitted Content</b>").

            <h2>2. License to Udemy</h2>
            <p>
                You grant Udemy the rights detailed in the <a href="/terms/">Terms of Use</a> to offer, market, and
                otherwise exploit your Submitted Content. This includes the right to add captions or otherwise modify
                Submitted Content to ensure accessibility. You also authorize Udemy to sublicense these rights to your
                Submitted Content to third parties, including to students directly and through third parties such as
                resellers, distributors, affiliate sites, deal sites, and paid advertising on third-party platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unless otherwise agreed (including within our <a
                    href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013339928">Promotions Policy</a>), you have the
                right to remove all or any portion of your Submitted Content from the Services at any time. Except as
                otherwise agreed, Udemy's right to sublicense the rights in this section will terminate with respect to
                new users 60 days after the Submitted Content's removal. However, (1) rights given to students before
                the Submitted Content's removal will continue in accordance with the terms of those licenses (including
                any grants of lifetime access) and (2) Udemy's right to use such Submitted Content for marketing
                purposes shall survive termination.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may record and use all or any part of your Submitted Content for quality control and for delivering,
                marketing, promoting, demonstrating, or operating the Services. You grant Udemy permission to use your
                name, likeness, voice, and image in connection with offering, delivering, marketing, promoting,
                demonstrating, and selling the Services, your Submitted Content, or Udemy's content, and you waive any
                rights of privacy, publicity, or other rights of a similar nature, to the extent permissible under
                applicable law.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Trust &amp; Safety</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Trust &amp; Safety Policies</h3>
            <p>
                You agree to abide by Udemy's <a href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/categories/204119748">Trust
                    &amp; Safety policies</a>, <a
                    href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229233027">Restricted Topics policy</a>, and other
                content quality standards or policies prescribed by Udemy from time to time. You should check these
                policies periodically to ensure that you comply with any updates to them. You understand that your use
                of the Services is subject to Udemy's approval, which we may grant or deny at our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to remove content, suspend payouts, and/or ban instructors for any reason at any
                time, without prior notice, including in cases where:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    an instructor or content does not comply with our policies or legal terms (including the Terms of
                    Use);
                </li>
                <li>
                    content falls below our quality standards or has a negative impact on the student experience;
                </li>
                <li>
                    an instructor engages in behavior that might reflect unfavorably on Udemy or bring Udemy into public
                    disrepute, contempt, scandal, or ridicule;
                </li>
                <li>
                    an instructor engages the services of a marketer or other business partner who violates Udemy's
                    policies;
                </li>
                <li>
                    an instructor uses the Services in a way that constitutes unfair competition, such as promotion of
                    their off-site business in a way that violates Udemy's policies; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    as determined by Udemy in its sole discretion.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.2 Co-Instructors and Teaching Assistants</h3>
            <p>
                The Udemy platform allows you to add other users as co-instructors or teaching assistants for Submitted
                Content that you manage, and you are required to comply with our <a
                    href="https://www.udemy.com/support/229605728/">Co-Instructor Relationship Rules and Guidelines</a>
                when taking such actions. By adding a co-instructor or teaching assistant, you understand that you are
                authorizing them to take <a href="https://www.udemy.com/support/229604308/">certain actions</a> that
                affect your Udemy account and Submitted Content. Violations of Udemy's terms and policies by your
                co-instructor or teaching assistant may also impact your Udemy account and Submitted Content. Udemy is
                not able to advise on any questions or mediate any disputes between you and such users. If your
                co-instructors have an assigned revenue share, their share will be paid out of your earned revenue share
                based on the ratios you have specified in your Course Management settings as of the date of the
                purchase.
            </p>
            <h3>3.3 Relationship to Other Users</h3>
            <p>
                Instructors don't have a direct contractual relationship with students, so the only information you'll
                receive about students is what is provided to you through the Services. You agree that you will not use
                the data you receive for any purpose other than providing your services to those students on the Udemy
                platform, and that you won't solicit additional personal data or store students' personal data outside

            <h3>3.4 Anti-Piracy Efforts</h3>
            <p>
                We partner with anti-piracy vendors to help protect your content from unauthorized use. To enable this
                protection, you hereby appoint Udemy and our anti-piracy vendors as your agents for the purpose of
                enforcing copyrights for each of your content, through notice and takedown processes (under applicable
                copyright laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and for other efforts to enforce those rights.
                You grant Udemy and our anti-piracy vendors primary authority to file notices on your behalf to enforce
                your copyright interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree that Udemy and our anti-piracy vendors will retain the above rights unless you revoke them by
                sending an email to takedowns@udemy.com with the subject line: "Revoke Anti-Piracy Protection Rights"
                from the email address associated with your account. Any revocation of rights will be effective 48 hours
                after we receive it.
            </p>
            <h2>4. Pricing</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Price Setting</h3>
            <p>
                When creating Submitted Content available for purchase on Udemy, you will be prompted to select a base
                price ("<b>Base Price</b>") for your Submitted Content from a list of available price tiers.
                Alternatively, you may choose to offer your Submitted Content for free. As a premium instructor, you
                will also be given the opportunity to participate in certain promotional programs under the terms of our
                Promotions Policy ("<b>Promotional Programs</b>").
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not opt to participate in any Promotional Programs, we will list your Submitted Content for
                the Base Price or the closest local or mobile app equivalent (as detailed below). If you opt to
                participate in a Promotional Program, we may set a different discounted price or list price for your
                Submitted Content as described in the Promotions Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a student purchases using a foreign currency, we will convert the relevant Base Price or
                Promotional Program price into the student's applicable currency using a system-wide foreign currency
                conversion rate set by Udemy and fixed periodically into a table of corresponding price tiers by
                currency ("<b>Price Tier Matrix</b>"). Since the Price Tier Matrix is fixed, those conversion rates may
                not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect when a transaction is processed. We reserve the
                right to update the Price Tier Matrix at any time. The Price Tier Matrix and additional information on
                Udemy's pricing tiers are available <a href="https://www.udemy.com/support/229605368/">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a student purchases through a mobile application, the mobile platform provider's pricing matrix
                will control, and we will choose the price tier closest to the applicable Base Price or Promotional
                Program price. Because mobile platforms impose their own currency conversion rates, conversions for
                mobile app prices may not match the conversions in the Price Tier Matrix.
            </p>
            <p>
                You give us permission to share your Submitted Content for free with our employees, with selected
                partners, and in cases where we need to restore access to accounts who have previously purchased your
                Submitted Content. You understand that you will not receive compensation in these cases.
            </p>
            <h3>4.2 Transaction Taxes</h3>
            <p>
                If a student purchases a product or service in a country that requires Udemy to remit national, state,
                or local sales or use taxes, value added taxes (VAT), or other similar transaction taxes
                ("<b>Transaction Taxes</b>"), under applicable law, we will collect and remit those Transaction Taxes to
                the competent tax authorities for those sales. We may increase the sale price at our discretion where we
                determine that such taxes may be due. For purchases through mobile applications, applicable Transaction
                Taxes are collected by the mobile platform (such as Apple's App Store or Google Play).
            </p>
            <h3>4.3 Promotional Programs</h3>
            <p>
                Udemy offers several optional marketing programs (Promotional Programs) in which you can choose to
                participate, as detailed in our <a
                    href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013339928">Promotions Policy</a>. These
                programs can help increase your revenue potential on Udemy by finding the optimal price point for your
                Submitted Content and offering them through subscriptions collections.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no up-front cost to participate in these programs, and you can modify your participation status
                at any time, though changes you make will not apply to currently active campaigns and certain programs
                may have additional requirements on termination.
            </p>
            <h2>5. Payments</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Revenue Share</h3>
            <p>
                When a student purchases your Submitted Content, we calculate the gross amount of the sale as the amount
                actually received by Udemy from the student ("<b>Gross Amount</b>"). From this, we subtract any
                Transaction Taxes, any mobile platform fees applied to mobile provider checkout sales, a 3% service and
                processing fee (except in Japan, where we subtract a 4% fee) for any non-mobile provider checkout sales,
                and any amounts paid to third parties in connection with the Promotional Programs to calculate the net
                amount of the sale ("<b>Net Amount</b>").
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have not opted into any of Udemy's optional Promotional Programs, and except for sales through
                instructor-generated coupon codes or course referral links as described below, your revenue share will
                be 37% of the Net Amount less any applicable deductions, such as student refunds. If we change this
                payment rate, we will provide you 30 days notice using prominent means, such as via email or by posting
                a notice through our Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you opt into any of the Promotional Programs, the relevant revenue share may be different and will be
                as specified in the <a href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013339928">Promotions
                    Policy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Udemy makes all instructor payments in U.S. dollars (USD) regardless of the currency with which the sale
                was made. Udemy is not responsible for your foreign currency conversion fees, wiring fees, or any other
                processing fees that you may incur. Your revenue report will show the sales price (in local currency)
                and your converted revenue amount (in USD).
            </p>
            <h3>5.2 Instructor Coupons and Course Referral Links</h3>
            <p>
                The Udemy platform allows you to generate coupon codes and referral links to offer certain items of your
                Submitted Content to students at a discount, at Udemy's current price, or for free, as permitted within
                the Services. These coupon codes and referral links are subject to limits, and you may not sell them on
                third-party websites or otherwise offer them in exchange for compensation. Additional information and
                restrictions on these coupon codes and referral links are outlined in our <a
                    href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/categories/204119748">Trust &amp; Safety policies</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where a student applies your coupon code or referral link at checkout, your revenue share will be 97% of
                the Net Amount less any applicable deductions, such as student refunds.
            </p>
            <h3>5.3 Receiving Payments</h3>
            <p>
                For us to pay you in a timely manner, you must own a PayPal, Payoneer, or U.S. bank account (for U.S.
                residents only) in good standing and must keep us informed of the correct email associated with your
                account. You must also provide any identifying information or tax documentation (such as a W-9 or W-8)
                necessary for payment of amounts due, and you agree that we have the right to withhold appropriate taxes
                from your payments. We reserve the right to withhold payments or impose other penalties if we do not
                receive proper identifying information or tax documentation from you. You understand and agree that you
                are ultimately responsible for any taxes on your income.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on the applicable revenue share model, payment will be made within 45 days of the end of the
                month in which (a) we receive the fee for a course or (b) the relevant course consumption occurred.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an instructor, you are responsible for determining whether you are eligible to be paid by a U.S.
                company. We reserve the right not to pay out funds in the event of identified fraud, violations of
                intellectual property rights, or other violations of the law.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we cannot settle funds into your payment account after the period of time set forth by your state,
                country, or other government authority in its unclaimed property laws, we may process the funds due to
                you in accordance with our legal obligations, including by submitting those funds to the appropriate
                government authority as required by law.
            </p>
            <h3>5.4 Refunds</h3>
            <p>
                You acknowledge and agree that students have the right to receive a refund, as detailed in the <a
                    href="/terms/">Terms of Use</a>. Instructors will not receive any revenue from transactions for
                which a refund has been granted under the Terms of Use.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a student asks for a refund after we have paid the relevant instructor payment, we reserve the right
                to either (1) deduct the amount of the refund from the next payment sent to the instructor or (2) where
                no further payments are due to the instructor or the payments are insufficient to cover the refunded
                amounts, require the instructor to refund any amounts refunded to students for the instructor's
                Submitted Content.
            </p>
